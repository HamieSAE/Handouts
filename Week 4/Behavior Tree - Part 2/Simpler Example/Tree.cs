// This code is for the RootNode class which acts as the top-level node of the behavior tree. The class contains three child nodes, the PatrolNode, ChaseNode, and AttackNode. The Evaluate method checks the proximity of the player and based on the result, the method performs different actions.
// If the player is close, the method tries to attack the player by calling the Evaluate method on the AttackNode and checking if the state is SUCCESS. If attacking fails, it tries to chase the player by calling the Evaluate method on the ChaseNode and checking if the state is SUCCESS.
// If the player is not close, the method tries to patrol by calling the Evaluate method on the PatrolNode and checking if the state is SUCCESS.
// Finally, if none of the child nodes returns SUCCESS, the state of the RootNode is set to FAILURE.
